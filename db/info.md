# MDSpotify - DB Folder

This folder will contain the database used for MDSpotify.

It will be autogenerated and maintained through the backend server. However, the individual database file can be interacted with through the sqlite3 CLI tools.

Note that all database files (`.db`) are _not_ tracked by Git; they are marked to ignore in the `.gitignore` file.
