# MDSpotify - DB Folder

This folder will contain the database used for MDSpotify.

It will be autogenerated and maintained through the backend server. However, the individual database file can be interacted with through the sqlite3 CLI tools.

Note that all database files (`.db`) are _not_ tracked by Git; they are marked to ignore in the `.gitignore` file.

You will need to make two things:

1. A folder called files that contains the mp3 files you wish to be able to access
2. A file called `file.txt` that contains the necessary metadata for each file. Note that there is a parser in place and a template that is meant to guide addition/creation.
